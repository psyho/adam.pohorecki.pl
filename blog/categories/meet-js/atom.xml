    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 20th of April this year I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/meetjspl">meet.js</a> about <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. It was a much shorter (30min vs 1h) version of the one I gave at the <a href="/blog/2013/06/27/angularjs-talk-from-33rd-degree-conference/">33rd Degree Conference a month before</a>.</p>

<p>Since it was a JavaScript meetup, most of the listeners were already familiar with JS MVC frameworks, and a fair percentage of them was already familiar with AngularJS. That's quite impressive if you consider there were well more than a hundred developers there.</p>

<p>Not having to explain that SPAs are now a viable choice for writing web applications saved me some precious minutes and there was a lot more audience participation than I usually encounter - a good sign that the people could relate to what I talked about.</p>

<p>If things progress the way they do with AngularJS adoption, maybe the next time I talk about it I will be able to talk about advanced application patterns in AngularJS instead of introducing it for the nth time:) Fingers crossed.</p>
