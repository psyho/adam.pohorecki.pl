    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago a tweet reminded me about a talk I gave on the 6th of August on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/">KRUG</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One trend I&#39;m observing is a lot of rubyists being fed up with messy ruby ecosystem are getting excited or even switch to clojure.</p>&mdash; Piotr Solnica (@_solnic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_solnic_/statuses/390163528138899456">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>I &#10084; Ruby</h2>

<p>I have been programming in Ruby professionally for over four years now. When I was starting out, there were probably mere dozens of Ruby programmers in Kraków. Compared being one of the thousands of Java developers, programming Ruby felt almost exotic.</p>

<p>Not that long ago, being a Ruby programmer meant being on the bleeding edge of web development. You had to deal with immature and unstable libraries, crappy deployment options and IDEs that didn't offer much more than syntax highlighting. On the other hand, it also meant working with smarter than average people, who were drawn to this technology not just because it was new, but also because it was in many ways superior to the other options out there. I loved it.</p>

<p>A couple of years have passed and I still love Ruby. I actually love it so much, that I called my dog Ruby. However, the times have changed. Rubyland is no longer the domain of adventurous and industrious early adopters. Ruby is now mature, stable and "enterprise-ready". Somewhere along the way Ruby has become the responsible choice of a language for building web apps.</p>

<p>Let's face it: Ruby is a good language to know right now. The jobs are plentiful and well-payed, and the technology is still relatively modern, but progressively more safe and boring. The days of exciting and unpredictable Ruby are almost over, and soon I'll only be able to like it as a friend.</p>

<h2>I &#10084; Clojure</h2>

<p>I have come across this LISP on the JVM quite a while ago, but having had pretty bad experiences with Common LISP at my university, I never had much interest in it until in May of 2012 I came across a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">presentation given at RailsConf</a> by Clojure's creator, Rich Hickey.</p>

<p>I am a huge believer in Single Responsibility Principle. Most of my classes have one public method. I tend to avoid inheritance and heavily favor composition and delegation. Unfortunately, a language like Ruby punishes you for coding in this style - your small classes end up being split amongst hundreds of files and often wrapping a function in a class seems like an overhead.</p>

<p>Watching that video made me realize that maybe I should look into functional programming languages. After all, functions are smaller units of composition, and they are easier to combine. I watched a bunch of other Hickey's presentations and I got hooked on Clojure.</p>

<p>Compared to other functional languages like Scala or Haskell, Clojure, as a dynamically typed language, was much more up my alley (in the dispute between static typing vs TDD, I stand strongly behind TDD). It also appealed to me more than Erlang, since I mostly work on web apps, and Clojure seems to do better with those.</p>

<h2>Clojure > Ruby</h2>

<p>I read a couple of books about Clojure, started playing with the language and I fell in love with it.</p>

<p>Let's start with the fact, that Clojure is perfectly capable of expressing pretty much everything that Ruby can, most of the time just as concisely. This in itself is not much of an achievement, but factor into that the syntax of both languages. Even I could write a parser for Clojure. Do you know anyone who could write a parser for Ruby? Clojure's syntax is the perfect marriage of power and simplicity.</p>

<p>Clojure has real namespaces, where Ruby only has modules. Clojure's keywords can be namespaced as well. It avoids Ruby's method naming problems (like when two libraries adding a method with the same name to a class like String of Array). Clojure has ClojureScript. Clojure is well suited for multithreaded programming. Clojure has macros. Clojure is faster...</p>

<p>I believe that this is a great time to get into Clojure programming. The ecosystem is mature enough that you can find libraries to do pretty much everything you need (even if they are not overly polished). The people in the community are above the average, because they have learned Clojure, not because Clojure programmers are in demand, but because they wanted to. There are also plenty of books, screencasts and other resources to learn Clojure from.</p>

<p>Uncle Bob called Clojure "The Last Programming Language". I would settle for "The Next Big Thing". Dig in while it's hot:)</p>

<h2>Slides</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the presentation was not recorded, so all I have are these slides:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 20th of May this year I gave a talk about <a href="https://github.com/psyho/bogus/">Bogus</a> on <a href="http://drug.org.pl">DRUG</a>.</p>

<p>About a week earlier I gave a <a href="/blog/2013/06/27/bogus-talk-at-krug/">longer talk with the same title</a> on KRUG, but even though I kept the title, the second presentation couldn't be more different from the previous one. While the talk on KRUG was more encyclopedic and giving an overview of most of the Bogus's features, on DRUG I decided to go with a more storyline-oriented approach to give people a better idea of what Bogus's motivation is and why it really is a new generation mocking framework.</p>

<p>Event though this presentation does not fully describe the features of Bogus, it does show a few testing/implementation patterns and the problems you might run into (or avoid) with them.</p>

<p>I'm much happier with this presentation than the previous one, mainly because while safe stubbing is a very useful feature, it is also important to realize that the design of your system can have a huge impact on the reliability of your test suite.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 14th of May this year I gave a talk about <a href="https://github.com/psyho/bogus/">Bogus</a>, my mocking library, at the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/">Ruby Users Group</a>.</p>

<h2>Bogus</h2>

<p>Bogus is a mocking library that I've been working on for over a year now. It's what I like to call a "new generation" mocking library, as opposed to gems like Mocha, RR or rspec-mocks, which represent the "old generation".</p>

<p>What makes the new generation of mocking libraries different is the fact that it emphasizes safety. The new generation libraries won't let you stub methods that don't exist or with a wrong number of arguments. When creating test doubles, the new generation also tries to preserve the interface of a real collaborator, so that you don't run into problems with API drift.</p>

<p>Bogus implements all of the aforementioned safety features and more. Our goal is to give you a much higher degree of confidence in your (isolated) unit tests and to speed up your builds by letting you get rid of unneeded integration tests.</p>

    <link href="http://adam.pohorecki.pl/blog/2012/01/17/octopress-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-17T17:11:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://adam.pohorecki.pl/blog/2012/01/17/octopress-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/blog/octopress.png" title="Octopress logo" ></p>

<p>To inaugurate my blog, I decided that I am going to review the tool, which I use to manage it - <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, the self-proclaimed "blogging framework for hackers".</p>

<p>I have been using Octopress to manage the <a href="http://sckrk.com">Software Craftsmanship in Kraków</a> blog for a couple of months now, and now I decided to use it for my personal blog.
This post will explain why I chose it, and what I don't like about it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Octopress is great for programmers who want to take advantage of GitHub or Heroku for hosting their blog, it requires very little setup and comes "with batteries included".</p>

<p>However, it should be made into a gem, because forking the project on GitHub and working on the same source tree as the developer feels more than a bit "hackish".</p>

<h2>Using Octopress</h2>

<p>Octopress is a static site generator, that specializes in blogging, as oposed to some other solutions like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>, which are more generic in nature.</p>

<p>If you want to use Octopress, you should either fork the repo on GitHub or add it as a remote to your existing repository.
After that all you need to do is invoke <code>rake install</code>, modify a few config values and you are ready to start adding content.</p>

<p>Deploying to various destinations can be done with <code>rake deploy</code> after some setup.
The setup modifies the Rakefile that comes with Octopress, which in turn generates conflicts when you update later.
Out of the box, Octopress supports GitHub Pages, Heroku and Rsync as deployment options.</p>

<h2>The good</h2>

<p>The very best feature of Octopress is the "batteries included" approach, which I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>It comes with a bunch of plugins, like Twitter and GitHub integration, Disqus comments, deployment tasks and others.
The default template is mobile friendly, and will adjust according to the screen size.</p>

<p>Having so much from the get go saves you quite a lot of setup compared to some other solutions, so you can have a blog live in minutes after you install the tool.</p>

<p>Compared to Wordpress, Octopress is also much easier to customize, and the templates are much cleaner - it uses Mustache for templates and SASS for styles.
Also using Markdown for composing posts and VIM (does not come with Octopress;) for editing them is much more convenient than Wordpress's WYSIWYG editor.</p>

<p>As a static page generator, Octopress also has the advantage of easily backing up the blog content and versioning it, especially compared to the database backed tools like Wordpress.
Now I have an (almost) full copy of the blog data everywhere I check it out and on GitHub.
This is a huge win, because you don't want to worry about loosing your data.</p>

<p>Another great thing about Octopress is Solarized theme for syntax highlighting.
Check it out:</p>

<p><code>ruby Sample of syntax highliting
def hello_world
  puts "Octopress is awesome!"
end
</code></p>

<h2>The bad</h2>

<p>The biggest downside of Octopress for me is that <a href="http://sciruby.com/">almost</a> <a href="http://www.telenet.com.au/">every</a> <a href="http://jcsims.me/">blog</a> <a href="http://www.mariovisic.com/">which</a> <a href="http://hairysun.com/">uses</a> <a href="http://yagnesh.org/">it</a> <a href="http://nomedojogo.com/">looks</a> <a href="http://trucsdedev.com/">almost</a> <a href="http://duffomelia.com/">exactly</a> <a href="http://depth-first.com/">the</a> <a href="http://www.uru.ch/">same</a>.
You can customize colors very easily and even modify the templates that come with the default theme, but modifying colors is usually the biggest change most people (including me) make.</p>

<p>Octopress comes with only one theme, and different ones are not easy to find.
Thankfully the default one looks nice and is very well done.</p>

<p>Compare this with Wordpress, which has thousands of templates readily available, and your biggest problem is finding the right one.</p>

<h2>The ugly</h2>

<p>Right now, Octopress encourages you to fork the project to use it.
Whenever you want to update the "library", you have to merge or rebase the remote changes and since there are no release tags, you most likely will do it against master.
You will also probably run into some conflicts, because some core files, like Rakefile, need to be modified to store configuration.</p>

<p>In my opinion Octopress should move to the same model that Nanoc uses.
It should be a gem, which is easily installable and upgradeable, and only the customizable files should go into the user's project directory.
Instead of using Rake, it should provide its own commandline tool to accomplish common tasks like deployment or compiling the content.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Octopress is a great tool for programmers that want to start blogging without having to worry about customizing some static page generator or Wordpress.
It comes with beautiful syntax highlighting, responsive layout and useful plugins for integrating with applications like Disqus and Twitter.</p>

<p>The downside is that you should spend some time to customize the layout and styles, because most of the blogs that use it look very similar.</p>
