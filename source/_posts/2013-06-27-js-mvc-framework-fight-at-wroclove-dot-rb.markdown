On the 3rd of March this year I took part in a panel discussion (or more precisely: a "fight") about the current state of JavaScript MVC frameworks on [wroc_love.rb][wroclove]. I represented [AngularJS][angular], which is my framework of choice since early 2011. The other contenders were [Backbone.js][backbone], [Ember.js][ember] and [Hexagonal.js][hexagonal].

We discussed the role of single page apps, architecture, two-way data binding and a bunch of other stuff. The introduction slide I presented pretty much summarizes my position about how the frameworks in question compare to each other:
